# kset-events
A simple web application for displaying most
recent events from the KSET.org RSS feed.

It uses a simple proxy server as a solution
to bypassing CORS.

There are two proxy servers available: Node.js
server and Simple PHP Proxy, which is available at:
http://github.com/cowboy/php-simple-proxy/

To configure which one should be used, corsProxy must be changed in globals.js.
